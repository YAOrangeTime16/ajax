## AJAX API

### About the application
This is a card game application which includes three simple card games. It is made with the help of the "deck of card" API returning responses by json-file.
This application calls the API using jQuery's `$.ajax()` tecknology, and the API requires different URLs to be accessed for its json data, depending on e.g. how many cards the player wants to draw.

### APIs in this application
* Deck of Cards (AJAX / Main)
https://deckofcardsapi.com/

* Pokersolver (npm / Supportive)
https://github.com/goldfire/pokersolver
This is a supplimental API for this application.
I used it to get results of the third game (Five Card Draw), otherwise the coding should be way difficult.
